## About Me 
  
I am a first-year PhD student in mathematics at Harvard University advised by Lauren Williams. My main research interest is algebraic combinatorics, though I'm generally a fan of combinatorics of all flavors. Previously I have worked on projects involving hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes, graph domination, pattern avoidance, minimal additive complements, and combinatorics on words. I am currently thinking about problems involving cluster algebras. 
  
I spent the past two years in the UK sponsored by a Marshall scholarship. Last year I was a master's research student at Durham University, where I wrote a thesis "On Compact Hyperbolic Coxeter Polytopes with Few Facets" supervised by Pavel Tumarkin. I spent the 2019-2020 academic year in the Part III Mathematics program at Cambridge University, where I wrote an essay on "Tropical Structures in Mirror Symmetry" set by Mark Gross. 
  
I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2019. During that time, I had the pleasure of participating in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program, the University of Chicago REU, and the Duluth Combinatorics REU. I have returned to the Duluth REU as an advisor during the summers of 2020 and 2021.
  
## Research
  
### Submitted Papers
  
* [Unimodality and monotonic portions of certain domination polynomials](www.arxiv.org), 2021. With Grace O'Brien.
* [Sets arising as minimal additive complements in the integers](www.arxiv.org), 2020. With Noah Luntzlara.
  
### Other Work
  
* "On Compact Hyperbolic Coxeter Polytopes with Few Facets", a master's thesis submitted to Durham University under the supervision of Pavel Tumarkin
* "Tropical Structures in Mirror Symmetry", an essay written for the University of Cambridge Part III Mathematics Program and set by Mark Gross (available upon request)
  
  
  
## Other Interests
  
I am passionate about increasing diversity in STEM and access to mathematics for all students. Of course, there are many wonderful programs supporting mathematicians, but here are a few that I personally recommend. Please feel free to email me at the address toward the bottom of this page if you have questions about any of these programs.
  
**At Harvard:**
  
- Real Representations (support group for all underrepresented groups within the Harvard math department)
- Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics
- [Math Includes Mentorship Program](www.google.de)
  
**For Undergraduates**
  
- [Duluth Combinatorics REU](www.google.de)
- [Budapest Semesters in Math](www.google.de)
- University of Chicago Math REU
- Women and Mathematics Program at the IAS
- Graduate Research Opportunities for Women (GROW) Conference
  
Outside of mathematics, I also enjoy rowing, painting, puzzle gaming, running, and traveling.
